For our project, we investigated traffic accidents and the circumstances surrounding them.

Our data was obtained from __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)__

## Questions:
***
* Do the seasons affect number/severity of traffic accidents?
* Does the day of the week affect number/severity of accidents?
* Does the time of day affect number/severity of accidents?
